# k-Independence sets of multigraphs

The following code aims to examin a procedural construction of a minimum $k$-independent set for a given multi-graphical degree sequence. 

IPython notebooks for:
- building random multi-graphs
- performing a new deletion operator on degree sequence
- analysis of k-independence
- exploring possible proofing techniques
